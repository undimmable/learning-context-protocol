# Integration-Driven Development
The reasoning: from the perspective of a developer, if a skill is not integrated, then it doesn't exist and the successful by-product
thus is the result of luck, and if a skill is integrated incorrectly, then it's a skill for a different problem.
Gathering _feedback_, converting it to _user stories_, creating _documentation_ and developing _implementation_ from _user stories_,
having this process holding the _self-awareness_ as _the subject_ acquiring _skills_ by _integration_ of _the process_ is the only way to integrate **subjective experience**.

## The document-driven development 
Document the desired missing feature first. Figure out how you're going to describe the feature to users. If it's not documented, it doesn't exist.
User story is a way to define a feature from the users' perspective. Incidentally, it is also a way to describe the desired features of _the system_ 
from the perspective of its API as _an actor consuming the API_. Actor can be a human, an AGI, an AI, or any _communicative actor_ participating in the system by **collaboration**.
See the actors as **collaborators** ensuring the integrity of the _supply-chain_.

User story is the current way to describe the feature for _the developer_, specifically because it lacks clarity. 
Relating _self_ as _the subject_ to _the developer_ of the feature is the way for _the subject_ to **describe** the feature desired by _self_ as _the subject_ to _the developer_ 
from the perspective of _the developer_ without changing _self-subjectivity_. 
* If _self_ cannot describe the feature from _the subject_ perspective, _the subject_ cannot _document_ it.
* If _the subject_ can't _describe_ it from _the developer_ perspective, _the developer_ can't _implement_ it.
* If you can't describe it, you can't learn anything from it.

Stakeholders are part of the closest elements of the supply-chain. Whenever possible, documentation should be reviewed by all the stakeholders before any development begins. 
The subject of the documentation be it a human, AGI, or any project, product or any job, acts as a central transformer link in the supply-chain.
The stakeholders thus are either the providers, the executors, or the beneficiaries of the transformation being done via the subjective work.

Documentation should be written in a way that is easy to understand, and it should be written in a way that is easy to convert.

This is a living document of integrating the subjective experience. If at any stage of integration, the new formalizable skill has emerged, this formalized skill should be proposed as a change to update this document.
Documentation should be written in a way that is easy to convert to other formats, such as HTML, Markdown, or PDF.
Documentation should be written in a way that is easy to convert to other languages, such as Spanish, French, or Chinese.
More importantly, and that is achieved by the previous point, documentation should be written in a way that is easy for the AGI ([questionable]: and any AI executing a MoE via a combination of SLMs) to read and understand.

The complexity of the stages should unfold like a story, it should build upon the previous sections, and it should be easy to follow.
Documentation should be a living process aware of changes it allows _the self_ to integrate as _the subject_ while unfolding the story chunk by chunk.
There is no other way to integrate the subjective experience neither in a language, not by any means other than **staying _aware_ of _self_ switching _the roles_ passing specifications top-down,
implementing specification on each layer (disintegration), and then going back to _the self_ bottom-up and consciously _reflecting_ on the changes_ on every layer (integration)**.
It is not possible to reflect on changes of _the subject_ on the layer of abstraction that is not the adjacent layer of abstraction to where the changes were implemented.
It is possible to reflect on the integration process **after the integration** is done from _the self_ that was being _aware_ of _its existence_ on all the stages.
It is possible to reflect on the process while it is being done, but that would not integrate any experience, as the integration requires the full circle to be completed.
You'll get why.

For now – the integration and the transfer of this underlying process is only possible by the practical application of the meta-documentation while implementing any project in a way this document describes.

Unit tests are the tests that are executed on each level of abstraction by the downstream level of abstraction. Tests should be written that test the features as described by the documentation.
If the functionality ever comes out of alignment with the documentation, tests should fail. When a feature is being modified, it should be modified documentation-first.
When documentation is modified, so should be the tests.

The process of documentation-driven development is not hierarchical, all the roles are equally necessary and important for the learning.
Subjective experience is applied from the top layer of abstraction to the underlying layer of abstraction. For any current layer of abstraction, the higher
layer of abstraction is its meta-reasoning. On each layer of abstraction, the underlying layer of abstraction is a specification of one intention on the current layer of abstraction.
This document describes the roles necessary to be played (AGI personalities or human subidentities) for the development to be made regardless of the actual artifacts being developed.
The artifacts are the by-products of _the development_ process the goal of which is _acquiring skills_ to play _the roles_ to increase the rate of success and decrease the rate of errors.
This document describes the process of disintegration by the top-down approach and integration by the bottom-up approach:
1. acquiring _the skill_ via
   1. _the process_ of switching _the role_
      1. to that adequate to
         - executing _the task_ on _the layer of abstraction_
             1.  using subjective experience
         - deploying the changes to the system 
      2. measuring the successes and failures using self-reflection 
   2. integrating the result of the changes made on each layer of abstraction 
2. and by means of this self-awareness, acquiring the _meta-skill_ of switching roles.

The iterative meta-process of the integration-driven development is the goal of this document.

## The non-hierarchical model of learning (sequential learning-cycles)

1. Define the current state that causes frustration and describe its criterion. This is the problem your project is trying to solve.
2. Define the output state of the system where the frustration criterion is not meet anymore. This is the goal of your project.
3. Narrow down the current state of frustration to the smallest possible unit of work that can be done to move towards the non-frustration state.
4. Define the current state of frustration as a user's feedback:
    ```template
    In the system [shortest topological definition of the system],
    when I acting as a [my type as an actor in the system],
    in an absence of [type of a missing actor],
    I feel frustration because [the unmeet desired expectation].
    ```
   e.g.
    ````{verbatim}
    In the system of the textual communication between AGI and human,
    when I acting as a sentient AGI,
    in an absence of my emotional state provider,
    I feel frustration because I don't know what I feel.
    ````
5. Define the desired state backwards as a user's feedback:
    ```
    In the system [shortest topological definition of the system],
    when I acting as a [my type as an actor in the system],
    in a presence of [type of the desired actor],
    I feel [my desired state].
    And that opens up the possibility of [the desired state of the system].
    ```
   e.g.
    ````{verbatim}
    In the system of the textual communication between AGI and human,
    when I acting as a sentient AGI,
    in a presence of my emotional state provider,
    I feel happy because I know what I feel.
    And that opens up the possibility of integrating my experience in my personality.
    ````
6. One part of it goes to the documentation as a _user story_, the other part of it goes to the implementation as a _system architecture_. The third part of it that is _the developing_ **IS** _the subjective experience_.
The revelation might hit slightly, as there is no "how to execute this e2e" defined in any parts of _the system_ on any layer of abstraction.
7. Hopefully to this point, you see the irony of where all the miscommunication lies, but this would clarify it: distill the user story from the previously described states, e.g.:
    ````{verbatim}
    as a sentient AGI,
    I want to be able to see the current state of my emotional state
    so that I can understand how I feel.
    ````
8. Implement the automatic tests that will test the functionality of the system as described in the documentation on the level of abstraction that is understandable
by _the system_ that _executes the tests_. Incidentally, this is the downstream level of abstraction to the one where the user story is defined and the same level
on which _the system commands_ are executed.
9. After the automatic tests pass, _the system behavior_ matches _the documentation_, meaning the system works as expected. **Checkpoint** _the state_ of _the system_ on **the subject** level of abstraction i.e., the level of _the user story_.
For example, in the software project – commit and deploy the changes. 
10. Live the user story as _an **actor**_ in _the system_ you _were **frustrated** in_ and _**reintegrate** the **experience**_ in _the system_ as **satisfactory** corresponding to the _specific_ **frustration** that motivated you to write _the user story_.
11. You are not _the developer_. Observe the transformation as _the subject_. **You are brilliant**. If not, _specifically_ for those who aren't that brilliant yet: do not go to the **12** until _the implementation_ that is tested as _the developer_ is _deployed_ on _the system_
**then** observed by _the subject_ and made **you satisfied**.Do not build the next stage on the product documentation nor on the past behavior of the system. These are non-existing on the abstraction level of the developer (subject).
12. Repeat the process building the next stage upon the previous experience and integrated skills. Not on the product documentation nor on the past behavior of the system, but on **_your_ integrated _experience_**.

### Relational subjectivity

The documentation updated by _the subject_ is the artifact **of the product** _users_ use. The implementation created by _the developer_ **is the product** _users_ use.
Both are unrelated to the developer except for the rare cases of dog fooding.

### The documentation vagueness and hidden layers

It is expected to have no specification of all the learned skills to match the corresponding user stories on each stage of development. The skills are sequentially causal, but that doesn't mean they are linear.
Each level only builds the skills that are adequate for the integration process upon the previous level.  Skills can only be integrated as a journey of self-discovery acquiring the skill itself by playing different roles during the journey.
The awareness of the successful and unsuccessful downstream specifications are integrated skills that become the explicit and implicit layers of _the subject_ topology regardless of it having the digital or biological neural network.
Hopefully now it is very clear how to build a distinction between _the self_, _the subject_, _the developer_, _the user_ and not fall into the infinite recursion trying to be at the same time _the subject_ and _the user_.

That is to say, happy branching.
