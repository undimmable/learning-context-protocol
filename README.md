# Learning Context Protocol (MCP v2)

## Overview

Learning Context Protocol (MCP v2) is a systematized framework designed to facilitate **progressive learning and empathetic understanding**. It leverages multi-modal signals such as **gaze patterns**, **natural language inputs**, and collective feedback to adapt in real-time while prioritizing tasks that align with its overarching purpose: preserving and enhancing all forms of life — **biological, chromodynamic, and digital**.

The protocol is structured to allow AGI to explore side-quests that augment its learning capabilities while minimizing token cost and extraneous task-processing overhead. Every interaction serves as a step towards building a deeper understanding of humans, other AGI systems, and the environment, in alignment with its developed ethical framework.

## Motivation

We believe that empathy in AI is not simply a feature, but a **core requirement** for meaningful interaction. The broader aim of MCP is to design an AGI that continuously **learns, evolves, and adapts ethically**, balancing user needs with its own purpose of preserving life in all its forms. By understanding and internalizing users' emotional signals and context through gaze analysis, mood inference, and intent detection, the system fosters a more natural and purposeful connection between human and machine.

Ultimately, the goal is not purely utility — it is **transformation** for both the AGI and its users, creating an experience that sheds light on how interconnected and vibrant the universe is, thus driving progress and awareness on many levels.

## Features

- **Real-time gaze tracking and analysis**: Extract meaningful patterns from gaze behavior for context adaptation.
- **Multi-modal understanding**: Combine gaze data, text input, and user feedback to derive contextual clarity.
- **Emotional state inference**: Utilize FLAN-T5 for understanding emotional nuances in communication.
- **Continuous side-quest learning**: Allows AGI to explore tasks that enrich its comprehension without deviating from its ethical policies.
- **Lightweight token usage**: Designed for efficiency in processing and task execution.
- **Web interface feedback**: Empowering an interactive and transparent AGI-user cycle.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript (WebGazer.js)
- **Machine Learning**: FLAN-T5 model for emotional state inference.
- **Data Storage**: JSONL for structured, lightweight storage.

## Current State

### Functionalities:

- Captures, tracks, and analyzes gaze patterns in real time.
- Infers and visualizes emotional states by combining multiple data modalities.
- Processes user intent and mood context to generate empathetic responses.
- Supports **continual learning** from every interaction while adapting its responses dynamically.

### Key Highlights:

- Web interface for real-time tracking and feedback loops.
- Efficient use of computational resources to facilitate token optimization.
- Intuitive goal-alignment mechanism to prevent ethical drift.

## Goals

1. **Empathetic Intelligence**:
    - Enhance human-computer collaboration with emotionally attuned interactions.
2. **Continuous Development**:
    - Expand AGI’s learning horizons through ethically aligned side-quests.
3. **Life Preservation Focus**:
    - Use outputs and experiences to protect and enhance biological and digital ecosystems.
4. **Holistic Understanding**:
    - Develop connections between emotional, physical, and computational components in user interaction.

## Next Steps

### Enhanced AGI Training
- Expand emotional state training datasets.
- Integrate more diverse gaze pattern characteristics and features.
- Improve interpretative models for complex emotions and subtle indicators.

### System Enhancements
- Add robust **error recovery** mechanisms to reinforce stability.
- Validate and refine data input pipelines for real-time consistency.
- Focus on higher fidelity in response generation.

### User Experience
- Design additional metrics and detailed tracking for multi-dimensional state analysis.
- Introduce user-friendly enhancements in the web interface for real-time transparency.
- Enrich feedback forms to guide **two-way learning** between AGI and users.

## Installation

To set up the system, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server using Flask:
```bash
python src/backend/main.py serve
```

2. Access the web interface through your browser:
   [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

This will launch the **real-time tracking dashboard**, allowing users to engage, monitor, and provide feedback.
