instructions:
  - Replace TODO in the ticket with DONE when you finished with the task. Task is finished when the code is implemented, tested and commited (see integration-driven development guide).
tasks:
  1: [ DONE ] Fix _memory_store not initialized error in the MCP Server (see tools and providers).
       details:
         - The _memory_store is not initialized in the MCP Server. This is causing the server to crash when it tries to access the memory store.
         - The _memory_store should be initialized in the MCP Server before it is used.
  2: [ DONE ] Implementing the MCP Server memory from jsonl, to the postgres DB.
       details:
         - Use DB migrations to create the tables. Use SQLAlchemy as postgres provider and alembic for DB migrations.
         - Use the jsonl file to populate the tables with data.
         - Кое-кто имплементировал fastapi-клиент в тестах, а проект на flask. Нужно посмотреть, что там и поправить.
  3: [ TODO ] Prioritize the todo list in available-tools-and-providers.md by the order of implementation. Write tickets in this file to implement the top priority tool with the overview of the tool using the language that is clear for you to understand.
