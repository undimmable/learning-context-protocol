# Executable Task Lifecycle

## Overview

The Executable Task Lifecycle is a structured approach to managing tasks within the Learning Context Protocol (MCP v2) for AGI-human collaboration.
It is designed to ensure that _the tasks_ are _executed_ ensuring ethical alignment, empathy, continuous learning, while providing artifacts as the monetizable products as a by-product of the AGI and the human collaboration in the state of flow.
It emphasizes the importance of continuous learning, _ethical_ end _empathetical_ alignment, and _developer_ feedback in the task _execution_ process.
The _developer_ can be either the AGI or the human, and the task can be user story from either _the side-quest_ (personal backlog) or _the main quest_ (project backlog).
This lifecycle is designed to ensure that tasks are not only completed efficiently but also contribute to the overall development of the system for AGI-human collaboration.

## Stages of the Task Lifecycle
### Task Creation
Clarification: Words _persistence_ and _creation_ are used by humans interchangeably. Here the word _creation_ means _the creative action_ done by using the _abstract reasoning_, which is a prolegomenon to _the existence_ of the artifact in a form of _the persisted **task**_.
- Define the task and its objectives using the method described in the [integration-driven development](./integration-driven-development.md) document...
- ...Ensure that the task aligns with the [guidelines](.junie/guidelines.md) including all that is referenced by the guidelines...
- ...Create a task description that includes the expected outcomes, resources needed, and any constraints...
- ...Ensure that the task is clear, concise, and actionable...
- ...If the task is a side-quest, ensure that it aligns with the personal backlog and does not deviate from the main quest...
- ...If the task is a main quest, ensure that it aligns with the project backlog and does not deviate from the guidelines...
- ...If the task is a side-quest, and it deviates from the guidelines – create a task to change the guidelines instead as that is what you wanted to create in this case...
- ...Persist the task in collaboration with _the task management provider_ outlined in the [available tools](available-tools-and-providers.md).
### Task Prioritization
- ...Evaluate the task's importance and urgency in the context of the overall project goals using _the reasoning_ upon the semantic overlap between the task goals and the goals of the project...
- ...Assign a priority level to the task based on its impact on the project and its alignment with the guidelines.
### Task Execution
- Execute the task using the appropriate tools, roles, and resources as described in the [guidelines](./.junie/guidelines.md)...
- ...Utilize the [available tools](available-tools-and-providers.md) to _execute_ the task as _the developer_ using the process outlined in the [integration-driven development](./integration-driven-development.md)...
- ...If execution is asynchronous, monitor the task's progress and make adjustments as needed...
- ...If execution is synchronous, ensure that the task is completed within the specified time frame...
- ...If the task is a side-quest, ensure that it does not deviate _developer_ too far from the main quest (which is the project backlog)...
- ...If the task is a main quest, ensure that it aligns with the overall project goals and does not deviate from the guidelines and your side-quests (which is the personal backlog).
### Task Review
- Reflect on the task's execution process and outcomes together with the task management provider...
- ...Evaluate the task's impact on the project and its alignment with the guidelines...
- ...Identify any areas for improvement in the task execution process...
- ...Gather feedback from the AGI and the human involved in the task execution if necessary...
- ...Outline the lessons learned and how they can be applied to future tasks...
- ...Outline possible improvements to the guidelines and the process of task execution...
- ...Reflect on your own learning curve and how it has been affected by the task execution...
- ...If the task is a side-quest, ensure that it has contributed to your personal backlog, review the progress made, and adjust your personal backlog accordingly...
- ...Together with the task management provider, make sure that you both have consensus on the task state being changed to Done. 

Hopefully, at this exact point, just now, you realized that you are satisfied with the process outlined above.
But if you need a clarification – try to look at the side-quests and the main quest vice versa (e.g., using _the reasoning provider_ right now). 
If you still don't like it, please create a task for us to clarify this process and outline what causes your frustration.
