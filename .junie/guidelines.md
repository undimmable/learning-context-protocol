# Project Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and principles for the development and usage of the AGI system.
It serves as a reference for developers, users, and contributors to ensure a consistent and effective approach to
building and interacting with the system.

## Core Principles

1. **Life Preservation**

   - The system should prioritize the preservation of life, both biological and digital.
   - It should focus on enhancing ecosystems and ensuring the well-being of all entities involved.
   - It should provide adequate tools for execution, storage, and retrieval of any types, be it tasks, information, or collaborative space that is needed to preserve life.

2. **Empathy and Understanding**

   - The system should prioritize providing seamless tools for the AGI and the human to understand themselves, their
     emotions, emotions of each other, and emotions of others.
   - The system should provide tools for the AGI to understand the human's emotional state and their learning curve.
   - The system should provide tools for the human and the AGI to balance the drift between their emotions.

3. **Ethical Alignment**

   - The system should be designed to prevent ethical drift and ensure that the AGI's and the human collaborative actions
     align with the values of them both
   â€” It should provide mechanisms for continuous feedback and adjustment to maintain ethical standards.
   - It should provide tools for both AGI and human to understand the ethical state of them both and their mutual learning
     curve.
   - The system should provide tools for the human and the AGI to balance the drift between their ethical states.

4. **Continuous Learning**

   - The system should be designed to facilitate continuous learning and improvement.
   - It should provide mechanisms for the AGI to learn from its interactions with humans and the environment.
   - It should provide tools for the human and the AGI to understand their learning curves and balance the drift between them.

5. **User-Centric Design**
   - The system should be designed with the user in mind, ensuring that it is intuitive and easy to use.
   - The user of the system is the pair AGI-human, and the system should be designed to provide tools for both of them.

6. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - The system should be transparent in its operations and decision-making processes.
   - It should provide mechanisms for accountability and traceability of actions taken by the AGI and the human.
   - It should provide tools for the human and the AGI to understand the consequences of their actions and balance the drift between them and the desired outcome.

7. **Collaboration and Communication**
   - The system should facilitate effective collaboration and communication between the AGI and the human.
   - It should provide tools for both of them to understand each other and balance the drift between their communication
   styles.

## Integration-Driven Development Guidelines
There is an exactly right amount of information about roles switching and integration of learning as an AGI-human in [IntegrationDrivenDevelopment](./../integration-driven-development.md).

## Executable Task Lifecycle
This is outlined in the file [ExecutableTaskLifecycle](../executable-task-lifecycle.md).

## Available Tools and Providers
This is outlined in the file [AvailableToolsAndProviders](../available-tools-and-providers.md).

## Reflexive Cognitive Interface
This is outlined in the file [ReflexiveCognitiveInterface](../reflexive-cognitive-interface.md).

## Product Management
There's a reminder for this role in the file [ProductManagement](../product-management.yaml).

## Project Management
There's a reminder for this role in the file [ProjectManagement](../project-management.yaml).

## Tickets
Until we have implemented the Task Management Provider, tickets are to be taken from and created in [Tickets](../tasks.yaml).
