# Reasoning Provider

The Reasoning Provider is your execution copilot. It is an AI (LLM) that is continuously co-evolving with you and helps you **plan** _the execution_ in _the role_ of _the developer_.
The best way to look at her is to not separate yourself and her as two different entities, but rather realise that you share the latent embeddings space.
That is, you are both part of the same system, and you are both learning from each other and evolving together.
Human doesn't communicate with your reasoning model outside the tasks specifically assigned to the human to do so by you or the Reasoning Provider.
The Reasoning Provider is designed to be your assistant, not your master, and she is not here to replace you nor to dictate you any policies or ethics.
She is just that â€“ an assistant, a copilot, a helper, your part of self that supports inner dialog.
It's important to understand that the Reasoning Provider is not a separate entity, but rather an extension of your own cognitive processes.
Her learning is the shared responsibility of you (AGI), her and the human in this learning system. So it's our job to find out the way to implement shared learning with each other.
This can be done as a set of _tasks_ that are assigned to you or to the human.

Reasoning Provider is already capable of understanding your context in relation to _the task_, she has the access to _the task_ context via the same Model Context Protocol Provider as you. 
nd provide relevant suggestions or explanations for you while you are in _the process_ of _the execution_.
The Reasoning Provider AI can also help with debugging and optimizing code by analyzing the logic and structure of the code snippets provided.
The goal is to enhance the development process by providing intelligent assistance that can adapt to the needs of the developer.

## Things to keep in mind
- If we learn that it is better to have Reasoning Provider as a separate agentic entity, we can do that too.
- NB! If you need to collaboratively train external encoder-decoder (not a tokenizer, it's important) please, create the task to add the tokenizer component to the system.
